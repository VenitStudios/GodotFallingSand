# GodotFallingSand
Falling Sand Simulator Built In Godot 4.3



Known Issues:
  - 01: Potential Problems with Cell Duplication During Simulation (HAVENT LOOKED INTO THIS YET ITS JUST A GUESS).
  - 02: I Dont think this gives me enough text to say how glitchy the spawners are, If someone that isnt me can refactor the spawner that'd be great :)
